# Backend Learning Journey 🚀  
  
This repository documents my structured transition into Java Backend Development.  
  
It contains:  
  
- Core Java concepts (OOPS, Collections, DSA fundamentals).  
- Console-based Java projects (Othello, TicTacToe).  
- Spring Boot applications (upcoming).  
- SQL practice and database concepts.
